# WPverbCloudAccounts
verb.ink Cloud Accounts user details for WordPress.org sites

Description:
This is a simple WordPress plugin intended for WordPress Multisite. It creates a settings page where superadmins can list usernames for accounts that site admins can view for their reference. The plugin provides a simple page where users can view their usernames for other web apps included in their verb.ink subscription, along with instructions, such as for email, and a place for users to keep personal notes. It also includes built-in dialogs and superadmin-set new password acknowledgement checkboxes.

Installation instructions:

1. Copy the folder "verbcloudaccounts" to your wordpress plugins directory. (usually /wp-content/plugins/)

2. Then enable the plugin "verb.ink Cloud Accounts" from the plugins page in the admin dashboard. It can be network-enabled or enabled per site.

3. There are no options.

4. Only Multisite Superadmins can enter information in each site's "settings" page. Only site admins can view the information and make notes that are not visible from the superadmin view.

Notes:
This is not in the main WordPress repository because it is custom written specifically for verb.ink. However, in being consistent with the verb.ink policy of being able to duplicate one's entire account, the plugin is made available here.

Future roadmap is low-priority, but may include:
- Quick access dropdown from admin bar for site admins
- Non-multisite use for admins to manage accounts for users
- Ability for users to change their passwords through this interface
- Other web apps to be listed
- Customizable enough so it can be useful if added to the WordPress.org plugin repository

Special Thanks:
